The Fire Control System is a sophisticated prototype designed to simulate the functionality of an automated fire monitoring and management system. By leveraging modern electronic components and microcontroller technology, 
This project monitors temperature variations using an NTC Thermistor Temperature Sensor, with an LCD displaying real-time data and warnings based on predefined thresholds.

Components :

Arduino Nano:
Acts as the central processing unit for the system. It processes input data and controls output devices.

16x2 LCD Display:
Used to display system messages, alerts, or sensor readings.

Breadboard:
Facilitates connections between components without soldering, enabling a flexible circuit setup.

Wires:
Used to connect the components on the breadboard.

Potentiometer:
Adjusts specific system parameters or settings.

LED Indicators:
Provide visual feedback, such as system status or alert notifications.

Resistors:
Protect the components by limiting the current flow.

Power Source:
Supplies electricity to the entire system.

NTC Thermistor Temperature Sensor:
measures the ambient temperature and provides real-time data to the microcontroller.

Buzzer:
when the system detects abnormal conditions, such as high temperatures or other fire indicators. Its loud and distinct sound ensures that the alert is easily noticed, even in noisy environments.

Key Scenarios:

Warning: Fire Detected
Condition: Temperature exceeds the warning threshold.
Response: LCD shows "Warning: FIRE!", and a buzzer sounds an alert.

Critical Warning: Dangerous Fire
Condition: Temperature surpasses a higher danger threshold.
Response: LCD displays "Run-away NOW!", the buzzer changes to a more urgent tone, and a red LED activates

Conclusion:

The Fire Control System prototype represents a practical and efficient approach to fire detection and management. By integrating components such as the NTC thermistor for temperature sensing, a buzzer for audible alerts, and an LCD for real-time feedback, the system demonstrates the potential of combining microcontroller technology with reliable sensors. This project not only highlights the importance of early fire detection but also emphasizes the feasibility of implementing cost-effective, scalable solutions for fire safety in both residential and industrial settings.
